**Background**

Hey! For me, it was necessary to use apollo-client with Vite 2. And while there are no clean libraries that will work only with Vuejs, then we will manage with what we have. The Apollo team wrote a client only for react and therefore we have to mess things up from: ```@apollo/client/core```

# Start ðŸš€

First, we need to install the ```@apollo/client``` package. This can be done with the command below:

    npm i @apollo/client // OR yarn add @apollo/client

<br>

Then I started setting up the configuration to work with the backend.
```
// src/apollo/client.js

import { ApolloClient, HttpLink } from '@apollo/client/core'
import { InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client/cache'

const httpLink = new HttpLink({
  uri: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL
})

const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
  link: httpLink, 
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
})

export default apolloClient
```
<br>

We can now import apollo.js into the Vuejs component
```
// src/components/ApolloHello.vue

<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
import apolloClient from '../apollo/client.js'
import { EXCHANGE_RATES } from '../graphql'

const response = ref([])

onMounted(async () => {
  const { data } = await apolloClient.query({
    query: EXCHANGE_RATES
  })

  response.value = data.rates
})
</script>
```

<br>

You also need to make changes to ```vite.config.js```
```
{
    ...
    optimizeDeps: {
        include: [
            '@apollo/client/core',
            '@apollo/client/cache'
        ]
    },
    rollupInputOptions: {
        external: ['react']
    }
    ...
}
```

<br>

# What's next?
We can now use ```@apollo/client``` along with Vuejs. To try this stack, you can **clone the repository**.
